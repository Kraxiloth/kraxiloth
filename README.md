# Hi, I'm Kraxiloth 👋

Indie developer creating practical web tools for **Sorcery: Contested Realm** players and collectors.

I use AI-assisted development to research and accelerate, but I architect, review, refine, deploy, and fully own every codebase.

### Current Focus
- In-game resource & threshold tracking
- Private trade post formatting & pricing
- Community utilities for a growing niche TCG

### Featured Projects
- **[ResTracker](https://github.com/Kraxiloth/ResTracker)** — Mana, thresholds, life & play aid (successful community tool)
- **[CardScribe](https://github.com/Kraxiloth/CardScribe)** — Paste → parse → priced → polished Discord trade posts (live at cardscribe.sorcery.no)
- **[Sorcery](https://github.com/Kraxiloth/Sorcery)** — Main hub & experiments
- **[MountMimic](https://github.com/Kraxiloth/MountMimic)** — A simple World of Warcraft addon to help you match the mount your target uses (if you have it in your collection).
